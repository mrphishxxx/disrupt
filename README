* SMS Bomber:
The SMS Bomber module allows users to send an overflow of threads to victims phones. The threads are sent from Googles smtplib module. It is recommended to send a thread size of 10-15 for faster delivery. A sending thread package can be any size. Also, in order to overflow a user, the victim must have an iPhone. Though it works with android, the victim can block the sender whereas on iPhone, they cannot.

	- The carriers are set on an `if/elif` statement so if you do not see your victims carrier, simply add a new one and update the respository.
